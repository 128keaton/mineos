This is the github repository for MineOS Minecraft hosting and management scripts.

Goals for this version:

-Full user-management system co-ordinated with actually /etc/shadow passwords
-Self-contained, script-installable package with no external packages needing reconfiguration (e.g., webserver)
-Web user interface with modern Knockout templating
-Command-line usage
-Downloading and updating of Python scripts and Minecraft server software packages.
